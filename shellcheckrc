# This file configures shellcheck.
# It is called `shellcheckrc` instead of `.shellcheckrc` such that snap installs can read this file:
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues/2299#issuecomment-898840809

# Log all checks
severity=style

# Enable all checks
enable=all

# Then selectively disable some checks

# Title: var is referenced but not assigned.
# Reason: this makes sharing vars between files, harder, however there is better ways to do this, eventually remove this exception
#
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2250
# Title: Prefer putting braces around variable references even when not strictly required.
# Reason: Braces interfere with syntax highlighting, use only when necessary
#
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2312
# Title: Consider invoking this command separately to avoid masking its return value (or use '|| true' to ignore).
#
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2310
# Title: This function is invoked in an 'if' condition so set -e will be disabled. Invoke separately if failures should cause the script to exit.
# Reason: obviously, hence why it was written that way
